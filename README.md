# react-native-responsive-screen

<i>react-native-responsive-screen</i> is a small library that provides 2 simple methods so that React Native developers can code their UI elements fully responsive. No media queries needed.

It also provides an optional third method for screen orienation detection and automatic rerendering according to new dimensions.

Give it a try and make your life simpler!

# Inspiration

As web developers we are familiar with CSS percentage values. Unfortunately, percentages are not fully supported in React Native, at least not yet. I.E. `margin`, `border-width`, `border-radius` properties do not support percentage values at all.

This package provides a way to use percentages; the developer provides percentage stings as arguments and the methods calculate the “correct” independent pixel (dp) values for every different screen dynamically.

# Installation

`npm install react-native-responsive-screen --save`

# Usage

## 1. How to use with StyleSheet.create() and without orientation change support 
```javascript
import {widthPercentageToDP as wp, heightPercentageToDP as hp} from 'react-native-responsive-screen';

class Login extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <View style={styles.textWrapper}>
          <Text style={styles.myText}>Login</Text>
        </View>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1 },
  textWrapper: {
    height: hp('70%'), // 70% of height device screen
    width: wp('80%')   // 80% of width device screen
  },
  myText: {
    fontSize: hp('5%') // End result looks like the provided UI mockup
  }
});

export default Login;
```

# How do I know it works for all devices ?

As mentioned in ["How to Develop Responsive UIs with React Native"](https://medium.com/building-with-react-native/how-to-develop-responsive-uis-with-react-native-1x03-a448097c9503) article, this solution is already in production apps and is tested with a set of Android, iOS emulators of different screen specs, in order to verify that we always have the same end result.

## Example:
The 4 blue tiles at the bottom half of the screen should take over 98% of the screen’s width in dp and 10% of the screen’s height in dp always:
